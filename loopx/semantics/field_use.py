"""Classify how each module uses a named payload field (RFC B3).

The retirement ledger used to count modules whose text contains the field
token. That metric answers "does this name appear here", which is not the
question retirement asks. Removing a legacy field requires knowing which
modules *read* it, which modules *write* it, and which merely mention it in
prose -- three populations the token count folds into one number.

What is measured here is syntactic use, not data flow. A module is a reader
when it performs a recognized literal-key read (``payload["legacy_field"]``,
``payload.get("legacy_field")``, ``"legacy_field" in payload``, or the
TypeScript property read). It is a writer when it performs a recognized literal
write (subscript store, dict-literal key, keyword argument, attribute store,
``setdefault``). Reader and writer are not exclusive: a projection module that
reads the legacy field and re-emits it is both.

These limits are part of the metric, not caveats around it:

* A computed key is **unresolved**. ``payload.get(name)`` may read any field, so
  no name-keyed scan -- lexical or syntactic -- can prove a module is not a
  reader. ``dynamic_mapping_key_sites`` counts those sites repository-wide, so a
  field measured at zero readers is measured against a stated unknown rather
  than declared dead, and a module that carries the field name as a bare string
  is reported as unresolved rather than as a mention. Subscripts with a computed
  key are deliberately *not* counted: ``rows[index]`` and ``payload[key]`` are
  the same syntax, and counting sequence indexing as an unresolved mapping read
  would inflate the unknown until it stopped carrying information.
* Same-prefix identifiers are different fields. ``legacy_field_repair`` is not
  a use of ``legacy_field``; both language AST scans compare whole keys.
* A field this module measures must not be spelled out here. The scan reads
  tracked sources under ``loopx/``, this file is one of them, and a field name
  in a docstring would add a mention to that field's own budget. The examples
  above use ``legacy_field`` for that reason; the real names live in the
  registry and in the smoke's anchors, outside the scanned Python/TypeScript
  sources.
* A mention is evidence of nothing. Prompt prose and module paths carry the
  token without a recognized access. Locals and parameters are instead bindings:
  they may carry the value through a signature that a migration must inspect.
