"""Pin the B3 retirement metric against finite counterexamples.

The metric replaces a token count with a syntactic role, so the tests that
matter are the ones that separate populations the token count merged: a reader
from a writer, a same-prefix identifier from the field, prose from an access,
and a computed key from an absent one.
